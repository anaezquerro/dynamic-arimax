# Welcome to <span style="color:green">`dynamic-arimax`</span> repository!

This is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) implementation of a new covariates selection method in Dynamic Regression Models. This proposal was published in: 

- [XoveTIC 2022 Conference](https://xovetic.citic.udc.es/).
- [IX Conference of R-Users in Galicia](https://www.r-users.gal/).

The PDF file of both proceedings are attached in this repository in folder `proceedings/`. We recommend reading at least one of the documents to use this code to deeply understand the mathematics of our method.

For any suggestion or issue with our code, please [contact us](mailto:ana.ezquerro@udc.es) in order to solve it and improve our implementation.

## Installation

In order to use this implementation and run all files, the following prerequisites are needed:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for automatic downloading of the necessary packages.
- R packages: [`fpp2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fpp2/index.html), [`tseries`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tseries/index.html), [`TSA`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TSA/index.html), [`seastests`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seastests/index.html), [`forecast`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forecast/index.html), [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/), [`prettydoc`](https://prettydoc.statr.me/), [`stringi`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringi/index.html), [`stringr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html), [`polynom`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/polynom/index.html), [`parallel`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/parallel/doc/parallel.pdf).
- [rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

Once [R](https://www.r-project.org/),  [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and [rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) have been installed, you can run [`installation.R`](installation.R) to automatically install all R-packages needed and [`test-installation.R`](test-installation.R) to check if all libraries have been correctly added.

## Structure of the module

- [`auto-fit.R`](auto-fit.R): Implementation of automatic fitting in ARIMA or ARIMAX models. It uses the [`forecast::auto.arima()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/8.17.0) function and iteratively removes non-significative coefficients.
- [`auto-select.R`](auto-select.R): Implementation of the covariates selection method and their respective correlation lags. For more information we suggest reading the proceedings attached to the repository.
- [`forecasting.R`](forecasting.R): Implementation of dynamic regression models forecasting once a model has been fitted with the selection function.
- [`plot-tools.R`](plot-tools.R): Script for fancy Plotly graphics.
- [`documentation/`](documentation/): Folder where documentation examples are provided.
- [`data/`](data/): Datasets needed to run  examples in [`EXAMPLES.md`](EXAMPLES.md).

## Simulation results 

We present in the following tables some metrics obtained via simulating $M=100$ scenarios where a dependent variable was artificially constructed via some randomly generated time series (modelable by an ARIMA model). Specifically, in each scenario:

1. Seven time series were randomly generated. Six of them were used as the set of covariates: $\mathcal{X} = \{X_t^{(1)}, ..., X_t^{(6)}\}$ and the remaining as the residuals of the model $\eta_t$.
2. Random lags $r_i \in[0, 6]$ for $i=1...6$, where selected for each covariate as well as regression coefficients $\beta_0,...,\beta_3$.
3. The dependent variable $Y_t$ was constructed via the DR model formula:

$$ Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{t-r_1}^{(1)} + \beta_2 X_{t-r_2}^{(2)} + \beta_3 X_{t-r_3}^{(3)} + \eta_t$$

We tested our selection method with different configurations:
- With different stationary tests (via `auto.arima()` function or Dickey-Fuller test).
- With different information criterions (AIC, BIC or AICc).

For more detailed information about the simulation procedure, please read the proceeding of the repository.
